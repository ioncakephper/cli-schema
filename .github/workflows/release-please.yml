# Name: Release Please Workflow
# Description: This workflow uses the googleapis/release-please-action to automate
#              the release process. It analyzes commits since the last release,
#              determines the next semantic version, and creates a pull request
#              with a changelog.
# Purpose: Automate versioning and the creation of release pull requests.
# Triggers: Push to the 'main' branch.
