# Name: Node.js Lint & Format Workflow
# Description: This workflow automates code style and quality checks using Prettier for formatting
#              and ESLint for linting. It ensures that all pushed code adheres to the project's
#              defined style guides before merging into the main branch.
# Purpose: Maintain code consistency and prevent common errors.
# Triggers: Push to 'main' branch, or pull requests targeting 'main' branch.
